// Given three String variables that have been declared and given values, firstName, middleName, and lastName, write an expression whose value is the values of each of these variables joined by a single space.

// So if firstName, middleName, and lastName, had the values "Big", "Bill", and "Broonzy", the expression's value would be "Big Bill Broonzy".

// Alternatively, if firstName, middleName, and lastName, had the values "Jerry", "Lee", and "Lewis", the expression's value would be "Jerry Lee Lewis".

firstName + " " + middleName + " " + lastName
